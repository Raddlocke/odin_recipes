    <p>This is my favorite basic pancakes recipe. The final product has a great vanilla flavor and a bit of sweetness. Feel free to increase the ratios and make a lot more pancakes. They freeze well to be eaten another day!</p>


    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp (14g) butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (25g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg (just use the yolk if you're making a half-batch)</li>
        <li>2 tsp (5 ml) vanilla</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (400 ml) milk or buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tsp (6g) salt</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp (16g) baking powder (or 1 tsp [6g] baking soda if using buttermilk)</li>
        <li>1.5-2.5 cups (200-300g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Additional butter for the pan</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter without getting it too hot. I usually microwave it for about 30 seconds or so and stir it until melted. You don't want it hot or the egg will cook from the heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix in the sugar.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Beat the egg in thoroughly</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix in the vanilla, milk/buttermilk, salt and baking powder/soda. Mix well and know that once you add flour you must be careful not to over-mix.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Start mixing in a conservative amount of flour, then keep adding until you get the thickness you want. The thicker the batter, the thicker the pancake. Be sure to not over-mix â€” the batter should be full of small lumps.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let the batter rest a few minutes while you heat up your pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat your cooking surface of choice (I use nonstick) to a low-moderate heat and smear it with butter. When the butter is just starting to brown, pour on the pancakes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When there are lots of bubbles on the surface, flip the pancakes and continue cooking until they look cooked, then cook another minute before removing to a cooling rack.</li>
    </ol>
