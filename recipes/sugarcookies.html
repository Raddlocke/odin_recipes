    <h1>Sugar Cookies</h1>
    <img src="../recipe_img/sugarcookies.jpg" width="400">

    <p>This is my favorite sugar cookie recipe. The inclusion of light brown sugar gives the cookies a nice chewy softness that will last for days. Of course, you can try to keep them around for a few days to see how good they stay, but we all know these will be gone before the day is through.</p>
    <p>You can really have a lot of fun with this one. Use different colors of decorative sugars when rolling, add sprinkles to your rolling sugar, whatever you can think of! Kids also love making these!</p>
    <p>Yields 30-32 cookies.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cups (358g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (224g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup + 2 tbsp (233g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (28g) light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Additional 1/4 cup sugar (for rolling)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium sized bowl and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cream the butter and both sugars together in a large bowl on medium speed until light in color and fluffy. You should be able to see the change in color and texture happen and know it’s ready.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract, mix until well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients and mix until the dough is well combined. It will be thick and shouldn’t be sticky. Do not over mix. Once it’s well combined, use a rubber spatula to help it come together to form a more cohesive ball.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Create 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of cookie dough. Gently roll into a ball, then roll each ball in the additional sugar to coat. Set the balls on the baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake cookies for 7-8 minutes. The cookies will spread and the centers will look soft, but should look done. Remove just before the edges begin to turn golden. Don’t over bake. The cookies will be a little puffy when you take them out of the oven but will fall a bit as they cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on baking sheets for 4-5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><h4>Notes</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking time may vary considerably. I recommend doing a test batch in the oven with 6 or fewer cookies to see how long they need to go in your oven.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The sugar amounts are important for these cookies. If you chose to use all granulated sugar, rather than a little brown sugar, the cookie won’t spread quite as much and will be a little thicker and a little less soft.</li>
        <br>
        <li>It is also important to properly cream together the butter and sugar. If not done correctly, the dough will be grainy/sticky and the texture of the cookies will be completely off.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Be sure to measure the flour accurately. The best way is by weight with a food scale, but if you don’t have one, give your flour a stir, then scoop it out with a measuring scoop. Do not pack it into the measuring cup.</li>
    </ul>
